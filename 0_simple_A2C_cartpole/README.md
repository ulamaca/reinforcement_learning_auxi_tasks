# Simple A2C Implementation:
- The first task in the project.
- This is my first tensorflow program and the first RL bot 
- The architecture is A2C (**A**ctor with **A**dvantage **C**ritic) to play one of the most basic task: Cartpole
- The code is inspired by the object structure in https://github.com/MorvanZhou/Reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow/blob/master/contents/8_Actor_Critic_Advantage/AC_CartPole.py
- This can serve as the simplest structure to test an advanced technology in the future.
  - Ex1: Using Bayesian Optimization to search for the best hyperparameters.

# Usage
- Prerequisite: TensorFlow and OpenAI Gym
- Run the code directly once the prerequisite is satisfied.
